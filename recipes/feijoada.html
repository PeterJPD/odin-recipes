<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Feijoada is a typical dish from <strong>Rio de Janeiro</strong> and is widely consumed throughout Brazil. Despite being a dish with many variations, the typical complete feijoada is the one that takes all the salted meats and is served with slices of orange.</p>
<p>As it is considered a <strong>heavy dish</strong>, there are those who prefer to make feijoada simple: for this, you can bet on using only sausage, bacon and jerky, making your feijoada dish lighter without losing <strong>flavor</strong>.</p>
